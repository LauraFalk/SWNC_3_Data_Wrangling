## 0. Awards and Accolades!
  ![](images/GoldenBison.png){width=200px} </br>
  Congratulations to Rachel, Kara, Carolyn, Rebecca, Ann, Jessica, Helen, and Anna: our first Golden Bison recipients.
    
  These individuals all successfully competed the second SWNC training on Github. 

## 1. GitHub Review

  View Data_Wrangling_Master.RMD to see information. Steps should be completed prior to opening this file.


## 3. Importing a CSV as a data frame

1. Install the library

    You will need the **CSV** library installed in order to import CSVs. Type **install.packages("csv")**. 

    Remember that install packages requires quotation marks within the parenthesis.
    
2. Import the file

    What file types can be imported?

    Most file types will have their own library to make it easy to bring the data into R studio. 
    Unsure what to use? Google "r read in <file type> file" to find the appropriate library.


    Today we will be using a CSV file, as this is the most common export from our databases.
```{r}
# Use the CSV library in this code

# Remember! Not all warnings are bad. A warning about "built under R version" and "overwritten [methods]" may appear, but it is just information for you in inconveniently-scary-red-text.
library(csv)
```

**To do** Use the read.csv() function to read in the csv from the /data folder.Use <- to assign it to the variable name groundhog_raw
```{r}
# Import the dataset

```

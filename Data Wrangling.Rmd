## 0. Awards and Accolades!
  ![](images/GoldenBison.png){width=200px} </br>
  Congratulations to Rachel, Kara, Carolyn, Rebecca, Ann, Jessica, Helen, and Anna: our first Golden Bison recipients.
    
  These individuals all successfully competed the second SWNC training on Github.
## 1. GitHub Review
1. Send Laura your GitHub username so that she can give you editing access to the repo.

    *Note for recording listeners*: You will not have editing access to the repository, you can still create a clone and follow along with a local copy. Please skip to step 3.

2. Create a branch

    Go to the location of the [SWNC Data Wrangling Repository](https://github.com/palacila/SWNC_3_Data_Wrangling). 

    Click on the **main dropdown** in the upper left, and begin typing your name separated by underscores. Once complete, click on **'Create branch:*your name* from main'**. This will create your branch! 

```{r createbranch, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("images/CreateBranch.png")
```

3. Clone the Repo
Click on **code** in the upper right, and copy the HTTPS url provided. 

```{r CloneRepo, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%",fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("images/CloneRepo.png")
```

4. Open R Studio. Go to **File>NewProject>VersionControl>Git** . Paste the repository URL. Information and download location should auto-populate. Click **Create Project**.

5. Switch to your branch in R studio. 

    Navigate to the Git Panel (upper right) in RStudio. If it is not there, you can go to **View >ShowGit** to view it.
Click the drop down menu in the upper right and select your branch name to switch to your branch!  

```{r SwitchBranches, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("images/SwitchBranch.png")
```

6. Open the RMD file titled **Data_Wrangling_Learner.RMD** by using the file tab in the lower right corner of R studio.

    We will be filling in the blanks of this document, then pushing the completed RMD files back onto GitHub. Please note that **Data_Wrangling_Master.RMD** is a completed copy of this lesson plan which can be used as reference. 
    
    Please fill in the author section of the header now.


## 3. Importing a CSV as a data frame
1. Install the library

    You will need the **CSV** library installed in order to import CSVs. Type **install.packages("csv")**. 

    Remember that install packages requires quotation marks within the parenthesis.
    
2. Import the file

    What file types can be imported?

    Most file types will have their own library to make it easy to bring the data into R studio. 
    Unsure what to use? Google "r read in <file type> file" to find the appropriate library.


    Today we will be using a CSV file, as this is the most common export from our databases.
```{r}
# Use the CSV library in this code

# Remember! Not all warnings are bad. A warning about "built under R version" and "overwritten [methods]" may appear, but it is just information for you in inconveniently-scary-red-text.
library(csv)
```

**To do** Use the read.csv() function to read in the csv from the /data folder.Use <- to assign it to the variable name groundhog_raw
```{r}
# Import the dataset
groundhog_raw <- read.csv("data/Groundhog_Data.csv")
```




```{r}

```
